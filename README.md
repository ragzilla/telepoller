# telepoller
snmp bulk polling, using influxdata/telegraf as a baseline

## vague instructions
* git clone 
* build telepoller_X binary by cd'ing to folder and running 'go build'
* copy telepoller_X.conf.dist to telepoller_X.conf
* customize as necessary
* configure telegraf to listen to telepoller_X.result topics
* run daemon
* send it job requests over nats topic telepoller_X.request somehow, scripting example:
  ```bash
  nats-pub telepoller_snmp.request '{"hosts":{"awesome.router":"192.0.2.0"},"params":{"community":"public","table":"ifMIB"}}'
  ```

## requirements
* a nats server (probably gnatsd)
* some snmp devices
* something to send poll requests (a shell script will do, but it's a naivÃ« implementation)
* InfluxDB with Uint64 support enabled
* Telegraf with Uint64 support (I should probably send this over to Influx, but, test cases).  In the meantime grab it [here](https://github.com/ragzilla/telegraf/tree/metrics-rewrite).
